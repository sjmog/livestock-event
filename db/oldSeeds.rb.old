	{ title: 'Livestock Event Achieves Record Attendance', author: 'RABDF Events Ltd', published: '2013-07-05T15:52:01+00:00', article_content: '<p>The Livestock Event attracted a record 9,130 visitors on Wednesday, day one at its NEC, Birmingham venue this week, while overall attendance was up 10% on the year at 15,740 head.</p> 

<p>“Rescheduling the event from its traditional September date to July has been a huge success with the visitor’s number on the first day the highest in 10 years,” says Nick Everington, chief executive of the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers.</p>

<p>“The main trade halls buzzed throughout, the technical demonstrations proved a huge attraction and the inaugural Careers Seminars were packed out as were the other Farm Health Planning, Feed Science Forums and Business Debates, a trend which differentiates the Livestock Event from other shows.</p>

<p>"In addition, moving the cattle in to the trade halls was an overwhelming success with 190 dairy stalls booked and 79 stalls for the inaugural National Charolais Show. We have had nothing but praise from cattle exhibitors who enjoyed the very modern facilities and once again, we have had a clean show.”</p>

<p>He adds: “We look forward to continuing to build on the event’s success in 2014 and creating the opportunity for all livestock farmers to get away from their farms to gain more knowledge and do business which is going to help them to progress their enterprises.”</p>'},
	{ title: 'RABDF Livestock Machinery and Equipment Award goes to G Shepherd Animal Health', author: 'RABDF Events Ltd', published: '2013-07-09T15:52:01+00:00', article_content: '<p>The RABDF Livestock Machinery and Equipment Award made to the product that delivers the most economic value to the livestock sector was presented to the Milkworks Gold colostrum pasteuriser from Lancashire company, G Shepherd Animal Health at the Livestock Event held at The NEC, Birmingham on 3 and 4 July.</p> 

<p>“The entry was a clear winner,” commented RABDF council member, Angus Wielkopolski chairman of the three-strong judging team. “We were impressed by the simple to use system which can potentially deliver much improved health. The machine also incorporates defrosting and cooling abilities using disposable bags which maximize the hygiene for each calf while minimising labour involved.”</p> 

<p>G Shepherd Animal Health’s Chris Shepherd commented: “We are thrilled to receive the award. The concept of pasteurising colostrum and calf milk is now being recognised as an important part of dairy herd health management along with further benefits to lifetime production, health status and profitability.”</p> 

<p>RABDF created the award for exhibitors to the Livestock Event to recognise the importance of machinery and equipment to the current and future profitability of the livestock farming industry. The judges appraised each of the seven entry’s innovation, its economic advantages to the farmer, running costs including replacement parts and prices, servicing requirements, safety features, energy usage, potential market and list price.</p>'},

	{ title: 'Inaugural National Charolais Show a great success', author: 'RABDF Events Ltd', published: '2013-07-09T15:52:01+00:00', article_content: '<p>The first National Charolais Show attracted an attendance of 63 head of cattle at the Livestock Event at the NEC, Birmingham, with Rumsden Gamble TI +41, SRI +42, taking the overall supreme champion title. The show, principally sponsored by Weatherbys and Melton Mowbray Market, included classes exclusively for Breedplan recorded bulls and females born between 1 January 2011 and 31 October 2012.</p> 

<p>Two year old heifer Rumsden Gamble, sired by Coley Hamish and out of Rumsden Dice, was tapped out as female and overall supreme champion by judge David Murray, Forfar, Angus, who commented: “This heifer was truly outstanding with great length, stretch and power. She also carried herself really well in the ring and is very feminine – a real cow-maker.”</p> 

<p>Gamble, exhibited by Rob Tremayne and Michelle Hanson, Helston, Cornwall, and bred by Rupert Taylor Ltd, Saxstead, Suffolk, had previously taken reserve female breed champion at Devon County Show and female breed champion at Royal Cornwall Show. Rob said: “We were always hopeful for success here but this was never expected. It’s a fantastic day for us and we’re looking forward to the future ahead, both at the local shows later this summer and to the cow that we hope she will become.”</p> 

<p>Standing reserve overall to Gamble was male champion Culford Hector TI +27, SRI +31, from Darren and Donna Knox, March, Cambridgeshire. Sired by Holstead Cracker and out of Culford Cherry, this 14 month old was bought as a calf at foot having been bred by C N Flack, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Judge David Murray said: “He’s a great young bull with an exceptional future ahead – a real good example of the modern British Charolais with great locomotion, topline and clean throughout.”</p> 

<p>Darren and Donna were delighted with their win: “We’re over the moon having come here with absolutely no expectations; Hector has done well at shows locally – taking junior male interbreed, reserve breed, and junior continental champion titles at Royal Norfolk Show last week – so to be placed at an event with such a high quality turnout of cattle would have been enough.”</p> 

<p>British Charolais Cattle Society chairman Alasdair Houston said: “We’ve had a fantastic day at the inaugural National Charolais Show at the NEC, with entries from throughout England and Wales putting on a fine display of young cattle. The event can and will go from strength to strength and we hope to attract even more entries next year.”</p><br /><h2>Full Results</h2><p>Class one: female born on or between 1 Jan 2011 and 1 May 2011</p>

At a presentation at the Livestock Event, The NEC, Birmingham, Charlotte and Gregory were each awarded a £500 cash prize.</p> 

<p>A certificate was presented to the two other finalists short-listed for the award: Victoria Kirby, an Extended Diploma in Agriculture student at Myerscough College and David McFarland studying at Glasgow Vet School.</p> 

<p>The annual award which was open to agriculture and veterinary students, required them to write a 1,500 word essay on proactive farm health management - a key element of the GB’s Animal Health and Welfare Strategy, and the benefits it brings to animal health and welfare and farm business profitability. They were asked to demonstrate an understanding of the environmental effects of disease and its likely impact on meat and milk quality, comment on the overall progress of the national health planning and management initiative and discuss the differences among the various livestock sectors and how one can learn from another.</p> 

<p>The essays were judged by a panel featuring dairy farmer and RABDF Council member, Derrick Davies, veterinary surgeon, Andrew Praill, and John Sumner, dairy consultant and award chairman. John commented: “This is the award’s sixth year. We widened the remit this year thus increasing the challenge. It is however evident from the essays that the level of understanding of the meaning and consequences of taking a proactive approach health management continues to increase amongst both sets of students.</p> 

<p>“We found it difficult to separate the top two in each group, but Charlotte and Gregory just had the edge. Charlotte demonstrated a good use of research and produced a well structured essay whilst Gregory’s essay was very relevant, to the point, and well presented.”</p> 

<p>John Reynolds of award sponsor, Volac said: “As first time sponsor of this award it has provided us with the opportunity to stress the importance of taking an holistic approach to best practice in livestock management. We would like to commend each of the finalists for having an awareness of the importance of adopting a proactive approach to farm health management covering all aspects, from biosecurity and environment to housing and nutrition. We are confident that this awareness will be of huge benefit in their future careers.”</p>'},
	{ title: 'Ayrshire supreme champion at National Dairy Show', author: 'RABDF Events Ltd', published: '2013-07-09T15:52:01+00:00', article_content: '<p>Loukat Lucky, an in milk Ayrshire was awarded the supreme title at the National Dairy Show at Livestock Event at The NEC, Birmingham on Wednesday 3 July. Lucky secured a maximum 50 points from the judging panel in the interbreed championship and the following day was among the winning Ayrshire team to secure the Bledisloe Trophy for the best group.</p> 

<p>Classified Ex93, Loukat Lucky was exhibited by Richard Bown, Worcester, Worcestershire, who purchased her in 2009 to join his Richaven herd of 70 Holstein and five Ayrshire milking cows. She calved her third 12 months ago, and after yielding 12,909 litres at 4.79% butterfat and 3.29% protein, she is still producing 38 litres a day. She has also just hit a lifetime yield of 40,000 litres.</p> 

<p>Lucky was no stranger to the ring having won the AgriScot Ayrshire championship in 2011 and 2012 and was nominated Ayrshire representative for the World Dairy Expo for the last two years.</p> 

<p>As well as Lucky, the Richaven show team included a further eight entries each making their show ring debut and they headed five out of six classes entered. Richard Bown’s homebred Richaven Goldwyn Della EX was awarded the reserve Holstein championship, the third homebred cow to take the title in successive years, while an honourable mention was made to his Carkin F C Michelle. The Richaven herd also took reserve honours with Richaven Adventure Stocking Red in the Holstein heifer championship class.</p> 

<p>Standing in overall reserve supreme position with 43 points was the Brown Swiss champion Soulseat Jublend Beatrice, classified VG89 and bred by Robert and Sheila McColm, Stranraer, Wigtownshire. She was also awarded the supreme interbreed best exhibitor bred title. A member of their 120 strong herd, Beatrice was in her second lactation, having recorded 7,000 litres at 4.26% butterfat and 3.47% protein as a heifer. A January-calver yielding 38 litres a day, she is the first Brown Swiss to take an interbreed award at the event, a fitting title in what is the breed society’s 40th anniversary year. Last week marked her second show ring outing, following success at the UK Dairy Expo in March where she took the breed championship. Beatrice formed part of a show team of five from the Soulseat herd, which also won the junior breed championship with Soulseat Pitagora Molly.</p>

<p>Reserve in the exhibitor bred championship went to Bluegrass Remakes Blackest Blonde, a 2010 born in milk heifer bred by Messrs B A Daw, Herford Heath, Hertfordshire.</p> '},
{ title: 'Young Charolais breeders out in force at stock judging final', author: 'RABDF Events Ltd', published: '2013-07-09T15:52:01+00:00', article_content: '<p>Fifty two finalists from nine UK regions battled it out at the British Charolais Young Breeders’ Stock Judging Competition sponsored by Weatherbys, hosted as part of the inaugural National Charolais Show at the Livestock Event, NEC, Birmingham, on Thursday 4 July.</p> 

<p>Winning the senior 19 to 26 year old section and the prize of an international trip was Gerard McShane, Strabane, County Tyrone, with 148 points out of 150. Twenty two year old Gerard, whose plans for the future are to carry on working with the family’s 10 cow pedigree Altnaderog Charolais herd with an additional 40 commercial cows, said: “I competed in stock judging for the first time at the finals last year so I’m really pleased with this result and look forward to helping my family breed even better show cattle in the future.”</p> 

<p>Winner of the special 18 to 21 year old class, requiring the top six competitors to give their reasons to master judge Alasdair Houston in the hope of winning the prize of a trip to the Agribition Show in Canada, was 20 year old Karyn McArthur, Balfron Station, Glasgow. She has just completed her final exams to become a veterinary nurse and helps out on the family farm where Charolais bulls are used over the 80 cow suckler herd. Karyn, who has won a previous stock judging title with Young Farmers as a junior, commented: “I feel very lucky to have won such an amazing prize and I can’t wait for my trip to Canada in November!”</p> 

<p>In the intermediate 15 to18 year old section, the top spot was secured with 148 points by 15 year old Stephen Taylor, Bannockburn, Stirling, who has tasted victory at national stock judging events previously. Stephen, who helps his father working for the Falleninch herd, said: “It’s great to win for the Scottish region. I’ve got a year left at school before I go on to agricultural college and would like to work with cattle in the future, so this win has given me a great boost.” Stephen also made up half of the highest place pair, winning the historic Fairway Trophy with Andrew Morton, Carronbridge, Denny.</p> 

<p>George Hollinshead, Crewe, Cheshire, sealed first place in the junior 8 to 14 year old section with 143 points. The 14 year old was delighted with his win: “Apart from a go locally earlier this year, this is the first time I’ve done something like this, so I’m really surprised. We have six pedigree Charolais and 50 commercial cows at home and I’m definitely hoping to go on to college then work on the family farm in the future.”</p> 

<p>Master judge Alasdair Houston said: “It was great to see so many stock judging youngsters and future breeders in the ring and to hear the fantastic reasons that many of them gave for their placings.”</p> 

<p>Katreen Millar, National Charolais Youth coordinator, was thrilled with the turnout: “I really want to congratulate everyone that took part, it was a fantastic finale to the first year of the National Charolais Youth programme and we’re looking forward to planning the next few events for our young breeders.”</p>'},
{ title: 'SHROPSHIRE DAIRY FARMING FAMILY TAKES 2013 GOLD CUP', author: 'RABDF Events Ltd', published: '2013-07-17T15:52:01+00:00', article_content: '<p>The Higgins family from Wilderley Hall, Pulverbatch, near Shrewsbury are this year’s winner of the NMR/RABDF Gold Cup. A family business in every sense of the word, brothers Andrew and Bill, supported by parents Bill and Margaret, manage the 316 cows and 266 followers that make up the pedigree Holstein Wilderley herd.</p> 

<p>Presenting the award at the Livestock Event RABDF Chairman and Chairman of the Gold Cup judges Ian Macalpine described this herd as a shining example of attention to detail right through the dairy business. “Every aspect of calf rearing through to the milking herd’s routines is managed with great care and to an exceptional standard. This herd is well bred, well cared for and as a result it is performing to a very high level which is reflected in its production data and its overall lifetime daily yield.”</p>

<h2>NMR/RABDF GOLD CUP WINNER</h2> 
<p>The Higgins have increased cow numbers and performance on their 145-hectare unit in the past 15 years through breeding their own top quality replacements. Cows have been bred consistently for production with good functional type. Their aim remains to breed a uniform herd of top cows. Calving is year round with a calving interval for the qualifying year of 433days. Milk is sold via Muller/Wiseman to Tesco.</p> 

<p>In the year to September 2012 this three-times-a-day milked herd achieved 12,718kg of milk at 3.81% fat and 3.03% protein. Average cell count was 68,000cells/ml.</p> 

<p>A team of three full-time staff and five part-time milkers are part of the Wilderley Hall team. They are an asset that the Higgins fully appreciate and admit that the high level of stockmanship shown by their team is integral to the success of their herd.</p> 


<h2>RUNNER UP AND NMR SILVER SALVER WINNER</h2> 
<p>Responsibilities are shared on this 154-hectare unit. James Tomlinson takes care of milking, fertility and health with the help of an assistant herdsman James Billington. His father David – with part time help from Russell Thompson– looks after the land work and feeding.</p> 

<p>Breeding decisions are based on a balance of type and production and have always underpinned the progress and success of this herd, which achieved an average yield of 10,538kg of milk at 4.41% fat and 3.14% protein on twice-a-day milking with an average cell count of 118,000/ml for the year ending September 2012. Milk is sold to local cheese makers Dewlay at Garstang. The sale of surplus heifers is also an important part of the business.</p> 

<p>With cow numbers now at 230 and 210 youngstock and more land recently acquired the Tomlinsons are set for expansion.</p> 

<h2>BREED SOCIETY AWARDS</h2> 
<p>Also presented at the Livestock Event was the Lilyhill Cup for the top Jersey herd and the Muchland Cup for the top Ayrshire herd among this year’s 500 Gold Cup qualifying herds.</p> 

<p>Winner of the Lilyhill Cup, awarded by the Jersey Cattle Society, is Swangrove Farms from Badminton, Gloucestershire. This 107-cow herd achieved a yield of 6,486kg of milk at 5.23% of fat and 3.72% protein with a cell count of 153,000 cells/ml.</p> 

<p>The Murchland Perpetual Trophy, awarded by the Ayrshire Cattle Society, went to John Adamson & Son from Pettinain, Lanarkshire. Their 157-cow herd achieved an average yield of 8254kg of milk at 4.33% fat and 3.31% protein. The herd average cell count was 147,000/ml.</p>'},
