Any such list shall not be treated as excluding any item which might have been included in such list having regard to the context of the contractual term in question. The ejusdem generis principle is not to be applied when interpreting the Agreement. General words are not to be given a restrictive meaning where they are followed by examples intended to be included within the general words.
