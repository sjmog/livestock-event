       <p>Doing business and obtaining quality enquiries is really what the Livestock Event is all about.  Farmers come with lists of products to see and people to meet, as well as to spend time learning about new ideas and products that will help make their enterprises more profitable.</p>
        
       <p>The Livestock Event gives your company the opportunity to market the full range of your livestock products to an audience of approx 16,000 visitors comprising of Beef, Dairy and Sheep Farmers together with an increasing number with Pig and Poultry enterprises.</p>
        
       <p>63% of farmer visitors have more than one enterprise giving you the opportunity to create more new business than at a single species event.</p>
